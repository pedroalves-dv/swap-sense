## Guide

**1 - Commit your code changes first (so your repo is up to date)**

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

**2 - Build your project (this generates the latest dist folder)**

```
npm run build
```

**3 - Deploy to GitHub Pages (this publishes the dist folder to the gh-pages branch)**

```
npm run deploy
```
